CMake is a very powerful cross-platform system for generating automated build systems.  On Unix it builds makefiles which it then runs, on windows, it normally builds projects for Visual Studio (though it can also build Makefiles using MinGW on windows).

CMake is used to build each of the wrappers for CoolProp.

Delphi `(information) <http://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi>`_ is a programming environment based on the Pascal language.  It is used for doing GUI development and other general programming.  There is an open-source equivalent of Delphi called `Lazarus <http://www.lazarus.freepascal.org/>`_ .

A very simple example of linking Lazarus and CoolProp can be found obtained by downloading the following 3 files:

* :download:`CoolPropDelphiExample.lpi`
* :download:`CoolPropDelphiExample.lpr`
* :download:`CoolPropDelphiExample.lps`

You will need to download the release shared library for your platform from :sfdownloads:`sourceforge <shared_library>` or the development version of the shared library from :sfnightly:`the nightly snapshots <shared_library>`.

Open Lazarus and then open the project file you downloaded.  Build and run. Place the downloaded shared library for CoolProp in the same folder with generated executable.

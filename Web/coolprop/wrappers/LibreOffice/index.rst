.. _LibreOffice:

*******************
LibreOffice Wrapper
*******************

A very simple example can be found here: :download:`TestLibreOffice.ods`.  You will need to download the release 32-bit __stdcall shared library for windows from :sfdownloads:`sourceforge <shared_library/Windows/32bit__stdcall_calling_convention>` or from :bbbinaries:`the development server <shared_library/Windows/32bit__stdcall_calling_convention>`.  Place the downloaded DLL in c:\\CoolProp

.. warning::
    
    This only works on windows.  There is currently no easy way to call shared libraries from linux or OSX.

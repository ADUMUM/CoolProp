There are two ways to link CoolProp and SMathStudio :
Remark: I used the first one, the second one isn't quite clear to me.

1) The easiest way is to download and install the portable SMath Studio distribution with Maxima, CoolProp and many other plugins :

2) To link CoolProp to SMathStudio_Desktop follow the identical instructions as given below for MathCAD 15 :

Notes :
- In October 2014 SMath Studio with CoolProp worked on Windows only. 
- The portable SMath Studio distribution is provided on the SMath Studio site, however so far it's indicated as inofficial (October 2014)

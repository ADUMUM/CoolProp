Available Wrappers
******************

CoolProp at its core is a C++ library, but it can be of interest to use this code base from other programming environments.  For that reason, wrappers have been constructed for most of the programming languages of technical interest to allow users to seamlessly interface CoolProp and existing codebases.  Downloads and instructions for each wrapper are included in the page for the wrapper.
